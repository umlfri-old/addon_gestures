Welcome to help for gestures!

Mouse gestures are useful modeling tool that can help you to manage your diagram with just a click of mouse.
There are three types of mouse gestures in UML. FRI, the element gestures, the system gestures and the connection gestures.

To activate gesture mode you must click on button activate. To deactivate gestures click on the same button which label is now deactivate.

In gestures mode you are able to apply gesture, just hold down the left mouse button and move the mouse to form the gesture.
You can also release the button and finish gesture with another move. Watch out for minimal move size.
When you click right mouse button, the gesture will be executed automatically. If the gesture is not recognized, the screen blinks. 

For element gestures the position of right button click indicates, where the element will be created.
The connection gesture can be created simply by click inside one element, and moving to another element.
If you want to have bend point release the mouse button and continue in creation with another move.
If you want to have special connection, draw general connection, after that draw desired gesture near one of the element.

To delete element or connection just scratch over the same place few times. 
In submenu settings you can set color, size of your gesture and set effects for system gestures.

HAVE FUN with gestures in UML. FRI. :)
